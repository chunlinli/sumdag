# Estimating and Inferring a directed acyclic graph from summary statistics

This repository contains the implementation of the paper 

- R Zilinskas, C Li, X Shen, W Pan, T Yang (2023). [Inferring a Directed Acyclic Graph of Phenotypes from GWAS Summary Statistics](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.02.10.528092v1.abstract). bioRxiv. Under review.

The code is maintained on GitHub and the R package will be uploaded to CRAN soon. This project is in active development.

Implementing the structure learning algorithms is error-prone. If you spot any error, please file an issue [here](https://github.com/chunlinli/sumdag/issues) or contact me via email -- I will be grateful to be informed.
